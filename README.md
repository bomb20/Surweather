# The Surveather Project #

The Surveather Project started as part of the NASA Spaceapp Challange 2016 in Würzburg
and was initialized by Sabrina Höhn, Robert Leppich and Vincent Truchseß.


## The Surveather Application ##

### What is it? ###

The Surveather App is a extended weather-app that shows not only plain weather data but also environmental data, such as air pollution, noise pollution and local allergens.
This shall be made possible by collaborative data-gathering done by the users.

At the Moment the application is in an early prototype-state but we look forward to continue the project. 


### What is the idea? ###

We hope to make a contribution to a more environment-aware society by giving the users the possibility state the conditions of his local area and give information that does not exist in the ordinary weather forecast.


### The features will be: ###

* Overview Screen with weather data and pollution state of your current location
* Map view with overlays to show zones with high air or noise pollution and local seasonal allergens(e.g. pollen).
* Easy-to-use commitment screen to commit environmental data
* Temperature graph-view with 5-day prediction
* Summary of general environmental state of your current location.
* Calculated predictions of continuing process of global warming
* Open Server API to give other developers the opportunity to use raw and calculated data
* Different versions for different user ages. (Current version is for kids)
